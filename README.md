# zenodo-new-version
Connect a zenodo deposition to your github repo with the 'zenodo-new-version' GitHub action.
Use this action only after you have already created a deposition.

This action:
1. Creates a new version of a Deposition given an ID of a prior version.
1. Replaces the prior DOI with the newly prereserved one in the documents found in the provided whitelist file; `whitelist_replace_doi` defaults to `.zenodo_whitelist_replace_doi`.

Be sure to chain this action with an upload and commit. The following example runs whenever a txt md or csv file are changed:

``` yaml

  push:
    branches: [ main ]
    paths:
